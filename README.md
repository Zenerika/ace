# Ace Adoption
This is the final project for "Phase 2" of the Flex course for [DigitalCrafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/) Houston. It is focused on backend technologies using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

> Project Description
> Your task is to build a copy of an existing web application using the backend technologies we have learned in Phase 2  [express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [knex.js](https://knexjs.org/), etc.

> You will not be designing something "new" for this project. Pick something that already exists and build it from scratch  with your team. Examples: a Twitter clone, a simplified Facebook clone, a basic forum, a small ecommerce website, etc. The  project scope should be well-understood and defined up-front. 

> You will need some HTML + CSS in order for the application to work, but it is ok to keep this part simple (hint: use a CSS  framework). Focus on thoroughness of the implementation using backend technologies like GET and POST requests, database schema > and queries, user authentication, form submission and validation, HTML templates, etc.

__Ace Adoption__ is a web application where users can login, find a new best friend and adopt them in a few easy steps.
