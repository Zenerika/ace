# Ace Adoption

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ace-adoption/ace.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ace-adoption/ace)

This is the final project for "Phase 2" of the Flex course for [DigitalCrafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/) Houston. It is focused on backend technologies using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

> Project Description
> Your task is to build a copy of an existing web application using the backend technologies we have learned in Phase 2  [express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [knex.js](https://knexjs.org/), etc.

> You will not be designing something "new" for this project. Pick something that already exists and build it from scratch  with your team. Examples: a Twitter clone, a simplified Facebook clone, a basic forum, a small ecommerce website, etc. The  project scope should be well-understood and defined up-front.

> You will need some HTML + CSS in order for the application to work, but it is ok to keep this part simple (hint: use a CSS  framework). Focus on thoroughness of the implementation using backend technologies like GET and POST requests, database schema > and queries, user authentication, form submission and validation, HTML templates, etc.

__Ace Adoption__ is a web application where users can login, find a new best friend and adopt them in a few easy steps.

## Tech Issues
These are the obstacles we faced:
<dl>
    <dt>1. Finding a data set with images
    <dd> We were able to use <a href="https://www.mockaroo.com/">Mockaroo</a> and a [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to create our db.
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt>2. Lack of documentation using Passport
    <dd>  Trial/Error + asking for help
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt>3. Working as a team and finding the middle-ground (back-end, front-end, OAuth)
    <dd>  Lots of communication, frequent pull requests, scrum meetings, and fixing merge conflicts.
</dl>
<dl>    
    <dt>4. Connecting all the pieces together (full-stack), but that's when we learned how to use Express Handlebars.
    <dd>  We learned how to use Handelbars for HTML templating and created multiple documents to seperate concerns. 
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt>5. Organizing the routes/middleware, so that all three database models/tables worked cohesively (User/Dog/Shopping Cart).
    <dd>  We were able to use the #if and #each Handelbar methods to connect, show and hide the approporiate pieces.
