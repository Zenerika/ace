# Ace Adoption

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ace-adoption/ace.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ace-adoption/ace)

This is the final project for "Phase 2" of the Flex course for [DigitalCrafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/) Houston. It is focused on backend technologies using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

> Project Description
> Your task is to build a copy of an existing web application using the backend technologies we have learned in Phase 2  [express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [knex.js](https://knexjs.org/), etc.

> You will not be designing something "new" for this project. Pick something that already exists and build it from scratch  with your team. Examples: a Twitter clone, a simplified Facebook clone, a basic forum, a small ecommerce website, etc. The  project scope should be well-understood and defined up-front.

> You will need some HTML + CSS in order for the application to work, but it is ok to keep this part simple (hint: use a CSS  framework). Focus on thoroughness of the implementation using backend technologies like GET and POST requests, database schema > and queries, user authentication, form submission and validation, HTML templates, etc.

__Ace Adoption__ is a web application where users can login, find a new best friend and adopt them in a few easy steps.  

## Collaborators
Our team includes:
* [Addison Verger](https://github.com/addisonverger)
* [Chiza Barber](https://github.com/schizaetrix)
* [Erika Aguirre](https://github.com/zenerika)

## Tech Used
This app used the following technologies:
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [PostgresQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/)
* [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/)
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
* [Trello](https://trello.com/b/adAfzpO1/ace)

## Tech Issues
These are the obstacles we faced:
* Finding a data set with images
> We were able to use [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) and a [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to create our db.
* Lack of documentation using Passport
- Trial/Error + asking for help
* Working as a team and finding the middle-ground (back-end, front-end, OAuth)
    -- Lots of communication, frequent pull requests, scrum meetings, and fixing merge conflicts.
* Connecting all the pieces together (full-stack), but that's when we learned how to use Express Handlebars.
    -- We learned how to use Handelbars for HTML templating and created multiple documents to seperate concerns. 
* Organizing the routes/middleware, so that all three database models/tables worked cohesively (User/Dog/Shopping Cart).
    -- We were able to use the #if and #each Handelbar methods to accomplish connect/show/hide the approporiate pieces.
